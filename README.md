# AUDIOPHILE

This was the final React project from The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. The main goal of this project was to build an e-commerce store using React. This project is an implementation of the Audiophile e-commerce website guru level challenge provided by Frontend Mentor. The design and requirements for this project were obtained from [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx). The design file can be found in root folder.

This project does not include a back-end code or database connection. Instead, data is imported from a static data.json file, and user cart information is saved in local storage.
